# MetaML
This is the final project for UIUC CS446 in Fall 2019. The link to the assignment can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/cs446-fa19). The project was in the cateogory of Automated machine learning or meta machine learning. The project used data from a collection of neural networks. The potential features were ["1.) Architecture description as a string and its hyperparameters 2.) The first X epochs of training and validation error history 3.) Initialization statistics."](https://www.kaggle.com/c/cs446-fa19/data). The labels were continuous data representing the final training and validation accuracy. The goal was to use regression machine learning models to predict these accuracies, with our accuracy quantified by an r<sup>2</sup> value. The final results were highly satisfactory with an r<sup>2</sup> value of 0.97304. For comparison, the best value in the class was 0.97651.
